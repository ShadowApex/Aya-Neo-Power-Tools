# Aya Neo Power Tools

This is a [SteamOS Plugin Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/PluginLoader) plugin forked from [NGnius/PowerTools](https://github.com/NGnius/PowerTools)that provides control for the Aya Neo line of handheld devices over various power settings such as TDP. We utilize the [RyzenAdj](https://github.com/FlyGoat/RyzenAdj) utility to interface with the hardware. 

## What does it do?

- Set GPU power parameters (TDP, Boost TDP)
- Display supplementary battery and system power use info
- Keep settings between restarts (stored in `~/.config/powertools.json`)
